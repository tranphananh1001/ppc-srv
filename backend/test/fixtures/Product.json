Say goodbye to flimsy, flat mats that do nothing at all to protect your floors, and say hello to the Easyology Designer Cat Litter Mat.</p>  <p>Finally, someone has created a cat litter mat that&#39;s actually big enough to catch all that mess! And not just the stuff that gets kicked out. The deep grooves in this mat also help brush off kitty&#39;s paws as he leaves the box, so there&#39;s less embarrassing (and disgusting) scatter being tracked around your house.</p>  <p>The extra-large Easyology Premium Cat Litter Mat measures 35&quot; by 23&quot;, so you&#39;re getting the very best floor protection available. Because it has such a stylish pattern and comes in designer colors, this mat beautifully complements your existing decor.</p>  <p><b>Long-Lasting, Durable PVC Plastic Cleans Up in a Snap</b></p>  <p>The PVC plastic makes our mat is super easy to clean - just shake it out or give it a quick vacuum. It&#39;s also water resistant and simple to soap up and rinse down, keeping it fresh and inviting for your feline friends.</p>  <p>The 3/8&quot; thickness stands up to heavy traffic and sharp claws while the soft plastic loops catch and trap more scatter. It&#39;s neat for you and provides a comfortable and soft surface for your kitty&#39;s sensitive paws.</p>  <p><b>Makes a Great Doormat, Too</b></p>  <p>The dirt-grabbing design and stylish appearance are perfectly suited for the front and back doors, so add a few extra to your cart.</p>  <p><b>If you don&#39;t love your Easyology Premium Cat Litter Mat, we&#39;ll refund your money, no questions asked.
